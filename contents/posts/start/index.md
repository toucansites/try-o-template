## Introduction

Thank you for purchasing Try-O-Theme! This theme is built on the powerful Toucan static site generator, which uses Markdown for content creation and Mustache templates for layout and design. This combination makes it simple to add, edit, and manage your site’s content while ensuring a visually appealing and professional design.

With Markdown, you can write formatted text in plain-text files, which Toucan converts into HTML. Mustache templates allow you to customize the layout and presentation of your site with clean, readable syntax. Together, they give you full control over both the content and appearance of your site.

This guide will walk you through essential tasks, such as changing the site logo, adding new content (tags, authors, posts), and customizing your site’s pages and footer. It also includes Markdown basics and instructions to deploy your site to GitHub Pages for a smooth publishing process.

## Change content

Customize your site’s content easily by following the guides below:

- [Change the site logo](/posts/change-site-logo): Learn how to replace the default logo with your own custom branding.
- [Add a new tag](/posts/new-tag): Categorize your posts by creating new tags to enhance navigation.
- [Add a new author](/posts/new-author): Showcase contributors by adding author profiles with bios, images, and social links.

- [Customize the footer](/posts/change-footer): Update your site’s footer with social links, copyright information, and custom text.

Each guide is designed to provide step-by-step instructions to make the customization process seamless.
