# Markdown Basics 2 - Links, Images, and Tables

Markdown allows you to include links, images, and tables in your documents with simple syntax.

---

## Links

### 1. Basic Links
Use square brackets `[ ]` for the link text and parentheses `( )` for the URL:
```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

### 2. Links with Titles
Add a title by including text in quotes after the URL:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com "Optional Title")
```

## Images

### 1. Basic Images

Similar to links, but add an exclamation mark ! at the beginning:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### 2. Images with Titles

Add a title in quotes for extra context:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg "Optional Title")
```

### Tables

Create tables with pipes | and dashes -:

```
| Syntax      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Bold**    | Bold text   |
| *Italic*    | Italic text |
```

### Code Blocks

## 1. Inline Code

Wrap code in backticks:

```
`inline code`
```

## 2. Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for multi-line code:

```
function example() {
  console.log(“Hello, Markdown!”);
}
```

### Wrapping Up

Markdown provides a simple way to include links, images, tables, and code in your content. Master these features to make your documents stand out!
